    "In a restaurant, a waiter recorded data on customers he served over a two month period in 1990. The dataset has been used to investigate relationships between certain measures such as tip, bill, size of party and sex of bill payer. In this project, I have analysed the data to answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. Is there a relationship between the bill and tip given? If so, what is its nature?\n",
    "2. Are there any other interesting relationships that emerge from the data?\n",

    "[These](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html) [three](https://medium.com/@mukul.mschauhan/data-visualisation-using-seaborn-464b7c0e5122) [sites](https://towardsdatascience.com/analyze-the-data-through-data-visualization-using-seaborn-255e1cd3948e) gave me some ideas as to what kind of plots might be suitable for the types of analysis I needed to do.\n",
    "This blog [post](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/128623_507fbe51532748f29278825fceedab85.html) and this case [study](https://dicook.public.iastate.edu/stat503/05/cs-tips2.pdf) influenced the direction I took with my analysis of the different variables.They convinced me that a relationship between the tip percentage and size of bill/size of party was an avenue worth exploring.\n",

    "In analysing a dataset such as this, there is a danger that an uncritical look at many combinations of variables will throw up some spurious relationships. The analyses I looked at included statements such as \"Female smokers are very consistent tippers\" and \"In parties of size 1, the sex of the bill payer depends on the day of the week\". To be fair, the case study that contained these statements stated \"There should be no temptation to\n",
    "make inference from the data, and emphasis should be on poking around the data to formulate hypotheses\". It is in this spirit that I chose the analysis that I did. I was looking for relationships that sounded plausible and may reward further exploration. That there is a relationship between bill paid and tip given is unsurprising and is likely to replicate in  other studies. The finding of a relationships between size of bill/party and tip percentage does not seem as robust, but further study of this question would be interesting."
